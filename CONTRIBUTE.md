# Contributing to the Helios GitHub Pages Repository

This guide will walk you through the process of adding posts to the Helios GitHub Pages repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
- A Markdown extension installed in Visual Studio Code (e.g., [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one))

## Cloning the Repository

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the "Source Control" icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`).
3. Click on the "Clone Repository" button.
4. Enter the URL of the Helios GitHub Pages repository: "https://github.com/Ztarbox/Helios" and choose a local directory to clone it into.
5. Click "Clone" to clone the repository.

## Adding a Post

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the cloned Helios repository folder.
2. Navigate to the `_posts` directory.
3. Create a new Markdown file with the following naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date and `post-title` is the title of your post.
4. Open the newly created Markdown file.
5. Add a YAML frontmatter to the top of the file, including the post's title enclosed in quotation marks, the date and time for the post in YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss -0000 format, and as many categories as you want for your post.

   - `layout`: The layout that should be used for thi   post. Typically, this will be `post`.
   - `title`: The title of the post.
   - `date`: The date of the post, typically in th   format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
   - `categories`: The categories to which the pos   belongs. This can be a single category, or a list o   categories.
   - `tags`: The tags to apply to the post. This can b   a single tag, or a list of tags.
   - `author`: The author of the post

   ``` yaml
   ---
   layout: post
   title: "My First Post"
   date: 2023-11-14 14:35:00
   categories: [blog, tutorial]
   tags: [coding, python]
   author: John Doe
   ---
   ```

6. Write your post using Markdown syntax ([Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)). You can include images by placing them in the `assets/images` directory and referencing them using relative paths (`![Image tool tip\](assets/images/example.jpg)`)

7. Save the file.
